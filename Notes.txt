Proxy.config.js file 
I have declared the port 9696 in this file and the API end point

And made changeOrigin=true
Mention it in package.json file

"scripts":{
   "start": "ng serve  --  -- proxy-config ./proxy.config.js"
}

if we directly call the API from service, it will result in CORS error.
Hence, we have create a proxy in front end
